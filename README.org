#+TITLE: Haudquaquam: Not At All Palmlike
#+AUTHOR: Janis Vivian Media Lago

* What is it?
Haudquaquam (HQQ) is a personal information database, very vaguely inspired by the
databases of PalmOS (which are much different and no doubt implemented more efficiently,
consistently, and succinctly than what I have laid out here).  It revolves around an
object-oriented, generic-programmed framework whereby databases are dedicated to objects
of a certain class, and multiple databases may be encapsulated within a single file that
also holds a user's entire session and settings (to be implemented more explicitly soon).
It is written in Common Lisp because I feel like it.

Haudquaquam will also eventually have an interactive, single-window graphical user
interface, implemented using [[https://mcclim.common-lisp.dev/][McCLIM]], and this will hopefully run pretty much anywhere.
However, if this proves to be too steep of a task, I may use a different GUI toolkit and
protocol altogether.
